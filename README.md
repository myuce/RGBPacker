# RGB Packer
A simple image packer that combines grayscale images into a single image.

# Installing & running
The only dependency needed to run RGB Packer is Pillow, which can be installed using the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

Afterwards, you can simply run `RGBPacker.py`. Optionally, you can also install PyInstaller and run `build.bat` to build an exe file if you want to build it yourself. Otherwise, you can get the prebuilt executables from [here](https://github.com/myuce/RGBPacker/releases).
